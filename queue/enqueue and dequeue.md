# Enqueue and Dequeue

## Prerequisites
Loops; Functions; Arrays; Structures

## Problem
In the below code, a queue <code>struct</code> has been implemented for you. It contains an <code>array</code> of size <code>CAPACITY</code>, an <code>int</code> indicating the current number of elements in the data structure, and another <code>int</code> indicating the index of the head of the queue at any given point in time. Implement the functions <code>enqueue()</code> and <code>dequeue()</code>, per the specification below. The <code>main</code> function that will be testing your implementation has already been written for you.

Hint: given the limited <code>CAPACITY</code>, you will have to think of how to move the <code>head</code> such that you can insert more than just 10 elements (assuming you removed some of them). <code>%</code> might come in handy...
Hint 2: Notice both functions are of type <code>bool</code>

Expected output:
```c
jharvard@run.cs50.net (~): ./a.out
Enqueueing 10 strings...done!
Making sure that the queue size is indeed 10...good!
Making sure that enqueue() now returns false...good!
Dequeueing everything...done!
Making sure that dequeue() returned values in FIFO order...good!
Making sure that the queue is now empty...good!
Making sure that dequeue() now returns NULL...good!
Making sure that the head wraps around appropriately...good!

********
Success!
