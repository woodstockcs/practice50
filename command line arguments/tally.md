# Tallying the Arguments

## Prerequisites
Loops; Arrays

## Problem
Write a program that prints out the total number of characters in the command line arguments given to the program. Ignore whitespace (for example, spaces, newlines, and tab characters), and ignore the program name. For example:
```./tally foo``` should indicate that 3 characters were given. ```./tally foo bar baz``` should indicate that 9 characters were given. ```./tally``` should indicate that 0 characters were given.

## Distribution Code

```c
#include <cs50.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main(int argc, string argv[])
{
    // TODO
    
    return 0;
}
```
